# Doubly-Linked-Lists
a program contains common operations such as insertion, deletion, printing elements in ascending or descending order

## Program Description
The program is designed to implement **a doubly linked list** to store integers which allows users to manage the list with several operations, including **insertion, deletion and printing the list elements in either ascending or descending order**. When users insert an new element, the list will by default store in ascending order. The program allows users to store a integer more than once. Regarding deletion, the program will only delete the first element it finds if there is more than one of the same integer.
